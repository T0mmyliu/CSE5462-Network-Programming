Simple file transfer application using TCP sockets. 
The file-transfer protocol will include a server called ftps and a client called ftpc. 

Usage:
    Start the server using the command 
        ftps <local-port>
    Then start ftpc with the command
        ftpc <remote-IP> <remote-port> <local-file-to-transfer>

    The new file created by ftps has the same name but it is in a sub-directory called ”recvd”
